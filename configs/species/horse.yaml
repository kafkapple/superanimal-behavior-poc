description: "Horse (side view)"

# Model configuration
model:
  type: quadruped
  use_keypoints: ${model.keypoint_presets.standard}  # 15 keypoints

# Sample video for testing
sample:
  name: horse_running

# Action classification thresholds
# Values are in body-lengths per second (normalized by body size)
# Horses have longer strides, so thresholds are adjusted
velocity_thresholds:
  stationary: 0.3   # < 0.3 body-length/sec = stationary
  walking: 1.5      # 0.3 - 1.5 body-length/sec = walking
  # > 1.5 = running/galloping

# Body size estimation
body_size:
  head_keypoint: nose
  tail_keypoint: tail_base

# Center of mass keypoint for trajectory
center_keypoint: back_middle
center_fallback: [back_base, neck_base]

# Behavior-specific settings
behaviors:
  # Gait analysis (horse-specific)
  gait:
    enabled: true
    # Gait types: walk, trot, canter, gallop
    trot_threshold: 2.0   # body-lengths/sec
    canter_threshold: 3.5
    gallop_threshold: 5.0
