# Used by run_cross_species.py for species-specific analysis

name: dog
description: "Dog (side view)"

# Model configuration
model:
  type: quadruped
  use_keypoints: ${model.keypoint_presets.standard}  # 15 keypoints

# Sample video for testing
sample:
  name: dog_walking

# Action classification thresholds
# Values are in body-lengths per second (normalized by body size)
velocity_thresholds:
  stationary: 0.5   # < 0.5 body-length/sec = stationary
  walking: 2.5      # 0.5 - 2.5 body-length/sec = walking
  # > 2.5 = running

# Body size estimation
body_size:
  # Keypoints used to estimate body length (nose to tail)
  head_keypoint: nose
  tail_keypoint: tail_base
  # Alternative measurement points
  # length_keypoints: [nose, neck_base, back_middle, tail_base]

# Center of mass keypoint for trajectory
center_keypoint: back_middle
center_fallback: [neck_base, back_base]

# Behavior-specific settings
behaviors:
  # Tail wagging detection (dog-specific)
  tail_wagging:
    enabled: true
    frequency_threshold: 2.0  # Hz
    amplitude_threshold: 30   # pixels
