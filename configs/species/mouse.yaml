# Model configuration

# Action classification thresholds
# Values are in body-lengths per second (normalized by body size)
velocity_thresholds:
  stationary: 0.5   # < 0.5 body-length/sec = stationary
  walking: 3.0      # 0.5 - 3.0 body-length/sec = walking
  # > 3.0 = running

# Body size estimation
body_size:
  # Keypoints used to estimate body length
  head_keypoint: nose
  tail_keypoint: tail_base
  # Alternative: use specific keypoints
  # length_keypoints: [nose, mouse_center, tail_base]

# Center of mass keypoint for trajectory
center_keypoint: mouse_center
center_fallback: [mid_back, neck]  # Fallbacks if primary not found

# Behavior-specific settings
behaviors:
  # Grooming detection (mouse-specific)
  grooming:
    enabled: true
    velocity_threshold: 0.3
    head_movement_threshold: 50  # pixels
